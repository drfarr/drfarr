#### Henlo fren, I'm Danny 👋🏿


A software engineer based in the UK with 100+ years experience and a passion for building beautiful, performant software that enriches the lives of my fellow humans.

I like to spend my free time rallying against choke point capitalism, understanding technology from a feminist perspective and making the technology space more diverse and inclusive for people of different races and genders and maybe animals at somepoint? 😀.

Let's work together! https://danny.engineering
