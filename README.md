#### Henlo fren, I'm Danny 👋🏿


A software engineer based in the UK with 100+ years experience and a passion for building beautiful, performant software that enriches the lives of my fellow humans.

Currently I'm :
- Rallying against choke point capitalism 🏦🔨🥰
- Understanding technology from a feminist perspective 💪🏿😘 
- Working to make the technology space more diverse and inclusive for people of different races and genders (and hopefully animals at somepoint😻)✊🏿😍

Let's work together! https://danny.engineering
